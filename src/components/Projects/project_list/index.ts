      Developed under the MERN (MongoDB - Express - React - Node) stack, and implements two big
      projects, The Frontend Client Application, and the Backend Server. As this, the development 
      of the Client and the Server is independent, and both "worlds" are connected via HTTP requests.
      
      The application presents Authentication Feature with JWT, Database service using MongoDB 
      and MongoAtlas, for the Client Side, React JS with Redux to manage the applicationâ€™s global 
      state, alongside with server requests.

      The application has an authentication feature, along with a Sequelize database, allows multiple 
      users to sign in, create notes, and persist them across sessions. Besides JQuery, the server 
      uses Handlebars.
