      The Starburst is the biggest project on the list, intended to be a Workspace Environment, 
      provides the user a place to design / develop projects, explore ideas, and keep a space to 
      brainstorm. The Web Application provides the user with the ability to create a project, and 
      inside the project, draw the designs, upload related files, and create a complex file 
      (markdown like), that allows to organize all the data that comes with creating and keeping 
      the progress of a project. 

      Much like a Notion application, but providing a file system to store multimedia, 
      tab system and calendar implementation. Inspired by Notion and the Jupyter Lab / VSCode 
      workspace.

      The application provides a MERN like stack, separated in 2 big projects, 
      the Client and the Server. The server provides Authentication, Database implementation with 
      Mongo Atlas, and Dropbox connection to store users' files.

      The client connects to the server via HTTP, and is separated in 2 main sections:
      - UI with ReactJS
      - API SDK to connect to the server

      The API SDK is used to provide ready to use, functions and classes to communicate
      with the modules provided by the server. Furthermore, this allows to developed UI and
      logic separately, which scales better, and provides less friction to changes.

      Both server and client are developed using Typescript, which ensures that the types,
      events, and codes matches across the overall codebase.

      The whole project is written with Typescript, providing a solid consistency and robustness

      The React Calendar is intended to be an application that "mimics" some features of

      Both the server and the Client are hosted in Heroku.

      Developed under the MERN (MongoDB - Express - React - Node) stack, and implements two big
      projects, The Frontend Client Application, and the Backend Server. As this, the development 
      of the Client and the Server is independent, and both "worlds" are connected via HTTP requests.
      
      The application presents Authentication Feature with JWT, Database service using MongoDB 
      and MongoAtlas, for the Client Side, React JS with Redux to manage the applicationâ€™s global 
      state, alongside with server requests.

      The application has an authentication feature, along with a Sequelize database, allows multiple
